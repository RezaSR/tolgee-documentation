Tolgee SuperDay is a hiring interview step - a day when we invite you to our office, and you will meet with our team. We will also
give you a real task, and we will work on it together. This is a great opportunity for you to see how we work
and for us to see how you work.

You will find us in the [office on the Sumavska street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/29hontuKJu353Tn29).

Tolgee super day takes 8 hours including the lunch and Fun time.

## The SuperDay schedule

### 1. Meeting with the team
First of all we will drink coffee or other drink together, and we will introduce you to the team. Then we will have a
short stand-up meeting.

### 2. Project setup and task selection
We will explain the basic architecture of the project while looking into the code. Then you will choose a task,
which you would like to work on. We have marked the tasks in the [Tolgee Platform repository with the `for-superday` label](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Afor-superday).
Please don't start working on the task before the SuperDay.

Then we will introduce you to the task requirements and show you relevant code parts.

### 3. Coding
You will work independently on the task. We will be available for questions and help.

### 4. Lunch
We will have lunch together in one of the restaurants close to the office.

### 5. More coding
After lunch, you will continue working on the task.

### 6. Fun time
We will go out for some activity like probably [pool in the nearby pub](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HVMyG6JgMft1b1Kh9).

## How to prepare
1. Please come to the office with your own laptop. If you don't have one, please let us know in advance
2. It will be great if you have installed **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate** on your laptop (there is 30 day trial available)
3. It will be super great if you have running Tolgee Platform project prepared. You can set it up by following [these docs](https://github.com/tolgee/tolgee-platform/wiki/Development).
  *(Please let us know if you face any issues with the tutorial*)
4. It would be nice if you go through basic principles of **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot** before the SuperDay.
